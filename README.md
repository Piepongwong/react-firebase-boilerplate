# React Firebase Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate app with firebase with the React firebaseui. A standard boostrap navbar, signup/login page and home page are also set up. There is a rudimentary, unstyled in app notification functionality build in. Don't confuse this with push notifications. It's just an animated pop up. I had success/error messages or realtime database updates from firebase in mind, but use it how you see fit.

Libraries:

* firebase
* react router
* bootstrap

To run: 

1. Copy paste your firebase settings in /src/settings/firebase-example.js and rename the file toe firebase.js
2. npm start
